<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>
<p>
"We will hold up wheat, we will
hold up meat, we will hold up munitions
of war and we will hold up the
world's commerce," says Herr <span class="sc">Ballin</span>.
Meanwhile his countrymen on the
Western front are content to hold up
their hands.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
It is reported from German Headquarters
that the <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> intends to
confer on Count <span class="sc">Bernstorff</span> the Iron
Cross with white ribbon. This has,
we understand, caused consternation
in official circles, where it is felt that
after all the Count has done his best
for Germany.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
"We are at war," says the <i>Berliner
Tageblatt</i>, a statement which only goes
to prove that there is nothing hidden
from the great minds of Germany.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
The report that Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Ford</span>
has offered to place his works at the
disposal of the American authorities
seems to indicate that he is determined
to get America on his side, one way or
the other.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
Mr. S.F. <span class="sc">Edge</span>, the famous motorist,
now on the <span class="sc">Food Controller's</span> staff,
has given it as his opinion that a
simple outdoor life is best for pigs.
We are ashamed to say that our own
preference for excluding them from
our drawing-room has hitherto been
dictated by purely selfish motives.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
America is making every preparation
for a possible war, and Mexico, not
to be outdone, has decided to hold a
Presidential election.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
It is true that Mr. <span class="sc">George Bernard
Shaw</span> has visited the Front, but too
little has, we think, been made of the
fact that he wore khaki&mdash;just like an
ordinary person, in fact.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
A sensational story reaches us to
the effect that a new journalistic enterprise
in Berlin is being devoted to the
"reliable reporting of news." We have
always maintained that to be successful
in business you must strike out on
original lines.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
An exhibition of Zeppelin wreckage
has been opened in the Middle Temple
Gardens. The authorities are said to
be considering an offer confidentially
communicated to them by the German
Government to add Count <span class="sc">Zeppelin</span> as
an exhibit to the rest of the wreckage.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
Members of the Honor Oak Golf
Club are starting a piggery on their
course, and an elderly golfer who practises
on a common near London is
about to write to <i>The Spectator</i> to state
that on Saturday he started a rabbit.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
The American Association for the
Advance of Science decided at a recent
convocation that the ape had descended
from man. This statement has evoked
a very strong protest in monkey circles.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
The tuck-shops of Harrow have been
loyally placed out of bounds by the boys
themselves, though of course these
establishments, like the playing fields
of Eton, had their part in the winning
of Waterloo.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
One of our large restaurants is printing
on its menus the actual weight of
meat used in each dish. In others,
fish is being put on the table accompanied
by its own scales.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
We are requested to carry home our
own purchases, and one of the firms
for whom we feel sorry is Messrs.
<span class="sc">Furness, Withy &amp; Company</span>, of Liverpool,
who have just purchased Passage
Docks, Cork.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
Australia by organising her Commonwealth
Loan Group, once again
lives up to her motto, "Advance,
Australia."</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
The Coroner of East Essex having
set the example of keeping pigs in
his rose garden, it is rumoured that
<i>The Daily Mail</i> contemplates offering
a huge prize for a Standard Rose-Scented
Pig.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
To be in line with many of our contemporaries
we are able to state definitely
that the War is bound to come
to an end, though we have not yet
fixed on the exact date.</p>

<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Curtin</span> has lost a great chance for

  <p class="i2">A pensive air of new-born grace,</p>

<p>For when the wild beast, held and bound,</p>
  <p class="i2">Ceases to plunge and rave and snort,</p>
<p>The Bench, I hope, will pass some sound</p>
  <p class="i2">Remarks on this contempt of court;</p>
<p>The plea for mercy, urged too late,</p>
  <p class="i2">Should prove a negligible cipher,</p>
<p>And when the sentence seals his fate</p>
  <p class="i2">He'll get at least a lifer.</p></div>

<h3>HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>The <span class="sc">Kaiser</span> and Count <span class="sc">Bernstorff</span>.</i>)</p>
<p>
<i>The Kaiser</i> (<i>concluding a tirade</i>). And so, in spite of my
superhuman forbearance, this is what it has come to.
Germany is smacked in the face in view of the whole world&mdash;yes,
I repeat it, is smacked in the face, and by a nation
which is not a nation at all, but a sweeping together of the
worst elements in all the other nations, a country whose
navy is ludicrous and whose army does not exist; and you,
Count, have the audacity to come here into my presence
and tell me that, with the careful instructions given to you
by my Government and by myself, you were not able to
prevent such an end to the negotiations? It is a thing
that cannot be calmly contemplated. Even I, who have
learnt perhaps more thoroughly than other men to govern
my temper&mdash;even I feel strangely moved, for I know how
deplorable will be the effect of this on our Allies and on the
other neutral Powers. Our enemies, too, will be exalted by
it and thus the War will be prolonged. No, Count, at such
a moment one does not appear before one's Emperor with
a smiling face.</p>
<p>
<i>Count B.</i> God knows, your Majesty, that it is not I who
have a smiling face. At such a moment there could be no
reason for it. But your Majesty will remember, in justice
to myself, that I have not ceased to warn your Majesty
from the very beginning that unless something actual and
definite was conceded to the feeling of the United States
trouble would surely come. First there was the treatment
of Belgium&mdash; </p>
<p>
<i>The Kaiser</i>. Bah! Don't talk to me of Belgium and the
Belgians. No more ungrateful race has ever infested the
earth. Besides, did I not say that my heart bled for
Louvain?</p>
<p>
<i>Count B.</i> The Americans, your Majesty, had the bad
taste not to believe you. It was in vain that I spread
those gracious words of yours broadcast throughout the
land. They only laughed at your Majesty.</p>
<p>
<i>The Kaiser</i>. Yes, I know they did, curse them.</p>
<p>
<i>Count B.</i> Then there came the deplorable sinking of the
<i>Lusitania</i>.</p>
<p>
<i>The Kaiser</i>. Oh, don't speak to me of the <i>Lusitania</i>.
I'm sick to death of the very name. Besides, how do you
dare to call her sinking deplorable? I authorised it; that
ought to be enough for you and for everybody else.</p>
<p>
<i>Count B.</i> I beg your Majesty's pardon. When I said
"deplorable" I was alluding not so much to the act itself
as to its effect on opinion in the United States. From that
moment the Americans stiffened in their attitude towards
us and became definitely and strongly unfavourable. I
warned your Majesty of this over and over again, but your
Majesty preferred to disregard what I said.</p>
<p>
<i>The Kaiser</i>. And have you any complaint to make? Is
your opinion of yourself so high that one may not without
sacrilege disregard your opinion?</p>
<p>
<i>Count B.</i> Your Majesty is pleased to jest. I am not
infallible, not being an Emperor, but I happen in this case
to have been right. And then on the top of all the other
things comes  the  Note  announcing  the  new  under-sea
policy, and the ridiculous offer to allow the Americans to
be safe in one ship a week, provided she is painted in a
certain way. No, really, with a proud nation&mdash;</p>
<p>
<i>The Kaiser</i>. Proud! A race of huckstering money-grubbers.</p>
<p>
<i>Count B.</i> With a proud nation&mdash;I must repeat it, your
Majesty&mdash;such a course must lead straight to war. But
perhaps that was what your advisers wanted, though I
cannot see why they should want it. But for myself I
must ask your Majesty to remember that I foretold what
has come to pass. There is perhaps yet time to undo
the mischief.</p>
<p>
<i>The Kaiser</i>. No, it is too late.</p>

   <hr />

<h3>AS OTHERS SEE US.</h3>
<p>
The General Officer Commanding, as he appears to:</p>
<p>
(1) <i>His Chief of Staff</i>.&mdash;The one insuperable obstacle to
tactical triumphs such as  <span class="sc">Cæsar</span> and <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> never
knew.</p>
<p>
(2) <i>His youngest A.D.C.</i>&mdash;A  perpetual fountain of unsterilized
language.</p>
<p>
(3) <i>Certain Subalterns</i>.&mdash;The greatest man on earth.</p>
<p>
(4) <i>Tommy Atkins</i>.&mdash;A benevolent old buffer in scarlet
and gold who periodically takes an inexplicable interest in
Tommy's belt and brass buttons. An excuse for his
sergeant's making him present arms.</p>
<p>
(5) <i>The British Public</i>.&mdash;A name in the newspapers.</p>
<p>
(6) <i>Himself</i>.&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Before dinner: An unfortunate, overworked
and ill-used old man. (<i>b</i>) After dinner: England's
hope and Sir <span class="sc">William Robertson's</span> right hand.</p>
<p>
(7) <i>His Wife</i>.&mdash;A very lovable, but helpless, baby.</p>

  <hr />
<p>
From an Indian teacher's report on the progress of his
school:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
"A sad experience. Spirits for a time were very high. Our menials
talked of exploits and masters of glory in store. But soon the famines
set in. The treachery of the elements ravished the hopes of agriculturists,
the major portion of the supporters of the &mdash;&mdash; school. The
puffs of misery bleached white the flush of early and latter times;
dinner-hours grew few and far between; and with the Sun of Loaf
sank all wakefulness to light and culture."</blockquote>

<p>
This last feature sounds a little like Berlin.</p>

<h3>THE THREE DICTATORS.</h3>
<p>
(<i>Being a tragedy of the moment and incidentally
a guide to the art of handing
out correspondence to the typist.</i>)</p>

<h4>I.</h4>
<p>
There are, of course, as many styles
of dictating letters as there are of writing
them; but three stand out. One
is the Indignant Confidential; one the
Hesitant Tactful; and one the No-Nonsense
Efficient. Bitter experience
in three orderly London houses only a
day or so ago chances to have led to
such complete examples of each of
these styles that the reader has the
felicity of acquiring at the same time a
valuable insight into business methods
and a glimpse of what Nature in the
person of Jack Frost can do with even
the best regulated of cities.</p>
<p>
We will take first the Hesitant
Tactful, where the typist is not merely
considered as a human being but invited
to become an ally. The dictator
is Mr. Vernon Crombie.</p>
<p>
"Oh, Miss Carruthers, there's a letter
I want to dictate and get off by hand
at once, because my house isn't fit to live
in through burst pipes. The plumbers
promised to send yesterday, but didn't,
and to-day they can't come, it seems,
and really it's most serious. Ceilings
being ruined, you know. The bore is
that there aren't any other plumbers
that I know of, and one is so at the
mercy of these people that we must go
very delicately. You understand. We
mustn't say a word to set their backs
up any higher than they already are.
Anger's no good in this case. Here
we must be tactful, and I want you to
help me. I knew you would.</p>
<p>
Now we'll begin. <i>To Messrs. Morrow
&amp; Hope. Dear Sirs,&mdash;I hate</i>&mdash;no,
that's a little too strong, perhaps&mdash;<i>I
much dislike</i>&mdash;that's better&mdash;<i>I much
dislike to bother you at a time when I
know you must be overworked in every
direction</i>&mdash;you see the idea, don't you?
What we've got to do is to get on their
soft side. It's no use bullyragging
them; understanding their difficulties
is much better. You see that, don't
you? Of course; I knew you would.
Now then. Where was I? Oh yes&mdash;<i>overworked
in every direction; but if,
as you promised yesterday, but unfortunately
were unable</i>&mdash;I think that's good,
don't you? Much better than saying
that they had broken their promise&mdash;<i>to
manage, you could spare a man to
attend to our pipes without further delay</i>&mdash;I
think you might underline <i>without
further delay</i>. Would that be safe,
I wonder? Yes, I think so&mdash;<i>I should
be more than grateful.</i> And now there's
a problem. What I have been pondering
is if it would be wise to offer to
pay an increased charge. I'd do anything
to get the pipes mended, but, on
the other hand, it's not a sound precedent.
A state of society in which
everyone bid against everyone else
for the first services of the plumber
would be unbearable. Only the rich
would ever be plumbed, and very soon
the plumbers would be the millionaires.
Perhaps we had better let the
letter go as it is? You think so and I
think so. Very well then, just <i>Believe
me, yours faithfully</i>, and I'll sign it."</p>
<p>
And now the Indignant and Confidential.
Mr. Horace Bristowe is dictative:
"Ah, here you are, Miss Tappit. Now
I've got trouble with the plumbers,
and I want to give the blighters&mdash;well,
I can't say it to you, but you know
what I mean. There's my house dripping
at every pore, or rather pouring
at every drip&mdash;I say, that's rather
good; I must remember that to tell
them this evening. Just put that
down on a separate piece of paper,
will you. Well, here's the place all
soaked and not a man can I get. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>
promised to send on Tuesday, they
promised to send yesterday, and this
morning comes a note saying that they
can't now send till to-morrow. What
do you think of that? And they have
worked for me for years. Years I've
been employing them.</p>
<p>
"Let's begin, anyway. <i>To Messrs.
Tarry &amp; Knott. Dear Sirs</i>&mdash;No, I'm
hanged if I'll call them dear. Ridiculous
convention! They're not dear&mdash;except
in their charges. I say, that's
not bad. No, just put <i>Gentlemen</i>. But
that's absurd too. They're not gentlemen,
the swine! They're anything but
gentlemen, they're blackguards, swindlers,
liars. Seriously, Miss Tappit, I
ask you, isn't it monstrous? Here am
I, an old customer, with burst pipes
doing endless damage, and they can't
send anyone till to-morrow. Really, you
know, it's the limit. I know about the
War and all that. I make every allowance.
But I still say it's the limit.
Well, we must put the thing in the
third person, I suppose, if I'm not to
call them either 'dear' or 'gentlemen.'
<i>Mr. Horace Bristowe presents his comp</i>&mdash;Good
Heavens! he does nothing of
the kind&mdash;<i>Mr. Horace Bristowe begs to</i>&mdash;Begs!
Of course I don't beg. This
really is becoming idiotic. Can't one
write a letter like an honest man, instead
of all this flunkey business? Begin
again: <i>To Messrs. Tarry &amp; Nott. Mr.
Horace Bristowe considers that he has
been treated with a lack of consideration</i>&mdash;no,
we can't have 'considers'
and 'consideration' so near together.
What's another word for 'consideration'?&mdash;<i>treated
with a lack of&mdash;a lack of</i>&mdash;Well,
we'll keep 'consideration'
and alter 'considers.' Begin again:
<i>Mr. Horace Bristowe thinks</i>&mdash;no, that's
not strong enough&mdash;<i>believes</i>&mdash;no. Ah,
I've got it&mdash;<i>Mr. Horace Bristowe holds
that he has been treated by you with a
lack of consideration which</i>&mdash;I wonder
if 'which' is better than 'that'&mdash;<i>a lack
of consideration that, considering his
long</i>&mdash;no, we can't have 'considering'
just after 'consideration'&mdash;<i>that</i>&mdash;no,
<i>which&mdash;which&mdash;in view of his long
record as</i>&mdash;What I want to say is
that it's an infernal shame that after
all these years, in which I've put
business in their way and paid them
scores of pounds, they should treat me
in this scurvy fashion, that's what I
mean. The swine! I tell you, Miss
Tappit, it's infamous. I&mdash;(and so on).</p>
<p>
The No-Nonsense Efficient businessman,
so clear-headed and capable that
it is his continual surprise that he is
not in the Cabinet without the preliminary
of an election, handles his
correspondence very differently. He
presses a button for Miss Pether. She
is really Miss Carmichael, but it is a
rule in this model office that the typist
takes a dynastic name, and Pether now
goes with the typewriter, just as all
office-boys are William. Miss Pether
arrives with her pad and pencil and
glides swiftly and noiselessly to her
seat and looks up with a face in which
mingle eagerness, intelligence, loyalty
and knowledge of her attainments.</p>

<h3>PETHERTON'S DONKEY;</h3>

<h4><span class="sc">or, Patriotism and Publicity.</span></h4>
<p>
I hadn't had a letter-writing bout
with Petherton for some time, and,
feeling in need of a little relaxation, I
seized the opportunity afforded by
Petherton's installing a very noisy
donkey in his paddock adjoining my
garden, and wrote to him as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="sc">Dear Mr. Petherton</span>,&mdash;I do not
like making complaints against a
neighbour, as you know, but the new
tenant of your field does not seem to
argue a good selection on your part,
unless his braying has a more soothing
effect on you than it has on me.</blockquote>

<p class="author">
Yours sincerely,
<span class="sc">Harry J. Fordyce.</span></p>

<p>
I was evidently in luck, as I drew
Petherton's literary fire at once.</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="sc">Sir</span> (he wrote),&mdash;I should have
thought that you would have been the
last person in the world to object to
this particular noise. Allow me to inform
you that I purchased the donkey
for several family and personal reasons
which cannot possibly concern you.</blockquote>

<p class="author">
Faithfully yours,
<span class="sc">Frederick Petherton.</span></p>

<p>
I translated this letter rather freely
for my own ends, and replied:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="sc">Dear Petherton</span>,&mdash;I apologise. I
had no idea that the animal was in any
way connected with your family. If it
is a poor relation I must say you are
fortunate in being able to fob him (or
should it be her?) off so easily, as he
(or she) appears to live a life of comparative
luxury, at little cost, I should
imagine, to yourself. I shall be glad to
know whether the animal, in exercising
its extraordinary vocal powers, is
calling for his (or her) mate, or merely
showing off for the amusement of
your fascinating poultry who share its
pleasaunce.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Can't you possibly fit the brute with
a silencer, as the noise it makes is disturbing,
especially to me, my study
window being very close to the hedge?</blockquote>

<p class="author">
Yours sincerely,
<span class="sc">Harry Fordyce.</span></p>

<blockquote>
P.S.&mdash;I am thinking of laying down
a bed of poisoned carrots for early use.
Perhaps with your chemical knowledge
you can suggest an effective top-dressing
for them.</blockquote>
<p>
Petherton rose to the bait and wrote&mdash;the
same night&mdash;as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;In your unfortunate correspondence
with me you have always
shown yourself better at rudeness than
repartee. Did you not learn at school
the weakness of the <i>tu quoque</i> line of
argument? You speak of your study
window being near my field. The
name "study" suggests literary efforts.
Is it in your case merely a room devoted
to the penning of senseless and
impertinent letters to unoffending neighbours,
who have something better to
do than waste their time reading and
answering them? I hope this letter
will be the last one I shall find it necessary
to write to you.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<i>Re</i> your postscript. Try prussic acid,
but pray do not confine it to the toilets
of your carrots. A few drops on the
tongue would, I am sure, make you
take a less distorted view of things, and
you would cease to worry over such
trifles as the braying of a harmless
animal. </blockquote>

<p class="author">
Faithfully yours,
<span class="sc">Frederick Petherton.</span></p>

<p>
Of course I simply had to reply to
this, but made no reference to the <i>tu
quoque</i> question. He had evidently
failed to grasp, or had ignored, the
rather obvious suggestion in the last
few words of my first letter on the
subject. I wrote:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="sc">My dear Chap</span>,&mdash;Thanks so much
for your prompt reply and valuable
information about prussic acid. There
was, however, one omission in the prescription.
You didn't say on whose
tongue the acid should be placed. If
you meant on the donkey's it seems an
excellent idea. I'll try it, so excuse
more now, as the chemist's will be
closed in a few minutes.</blockquote>

<p class="author">
Yours in haste,
<span class="sc">Harry F.</span></p>

<p>
Petherton was getting angry, and
his reply was terse and venomous:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;Yes, I did mean the donkey's.
It will cure both his stupid braying and
his habit of writing absurd and childish
letters.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
But if you poison <i>my</i> donkey it will
cost you a good deal more than you
will care to pay, especially in war-time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It is a pity you're too old for the
army; you might have been shot by
now.</blockquote>

<p class="author">
Faithfully yours,
<span class="sc">Frederick Petherton.</span></p>

<p>
I had now got on to my fourth speed,
and dashed off this reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="sc">Dear Freddy</span>,&mdash;I like you in all your
moods, but positively adore you when
you are angry. As a matter of fact I
am very fond of what are so absurdly
known as dumb animals, and am glad
now that the chemist's was closed last
night before I decided whether to go
there or not. <span class="sc">Balaam</span> himself would
have been proud to own your animal.
It roused me from my bed this morning
with what was unmistakably a very fine
asinine rendering of the first few bars
of "The Yeoman's Wedding," but unfortunately
it lost the swing of it before
the end of the first verse.</blockquote>

<p class="author">
Yours as ever,
<span class="sc">Harry.</span></p>

<p>
Petherton gave up the contest; but
I let him have a final tweak after seeing
the announcement of his splendid and
public-spirited action to help on the
War Food scheme.</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="sc">Dear old Boy</span> (I wrote),&mdash;How
stupid you must have thought me all
this time! Only when I learnt from
the paragraph in this morning's <i>Surbury
Examiner</i> that, in response to the
suggestion of the Rural District Council,
you have lent your field to the poor
people of the neighbourhood for growing
War Food did I realise the meaning
of the dulcet-toned donkey's presence
in your field.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The growing of more food at the
present time is an absolute necessity,
but it was left to you to discover this
novel method of proclaiming to Surbury
that here in its midst was land waiting
to be put to really useful purpose.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I do not know which to admire the
more, your patriotism or the ingenuity
displayed in your selection of so admirable
a mouthpiece from among your
circle of friends. </blockquote>

<p class="author">

Petherton has left it at that.</p>

"Corporal Cuthbert Crewdson," said
the Colonel in a kindly voice, "your work
has been very satisfactory&mdash;so much
so that I have decided to promote you.
From to-day you will no longer be
Corporal, but Lance-Corporal." With
a grateful smile our hero saluted and
retired to draw his lance at the Adjutant's
stores.</p>

<p>
One night, as Private Jones and the
Sergeant-major were strolling arm-in-arm
through the High Street...</p>

   <hr class="short" />
<p>
"Remember," said the old Major,
eyeing his eighteen-year-old subaltern
son with a shrewd affectionate glance,
"a little well-placed courtesy goes a
long way. For instance, if a Sergeant
should call you 'Sir,' never forget to
say 'Sir' to him."</p>

  <hr class="short" />
<p>
Osbert, his cane dangling from his left
hand and with Mabel at his side, sailed
proudly down Oxford Street. Suddenly
a Tommy hove in sight. At once Osbert
passed his stick to his other hand,
leaving the left one free. The next
moment the man was saluting, and
Osbert, bringing up his left hand in
acknowledgment, passed on.</p>
<p>
"It is always well to be scrupulously
correct in these little details,"
he explained.</p>

Mildred, her heart beating rapidly,

<p>
Sidney Bellairs, apparently so stern
and unbending on parade, was adored by
his men. Often he had been known,
when acting as "orderly officer" (as the
officer is called who has to keep order),
to carry round with him a light camp-stool,
which, with his unfailing charm
of manner, he would offer to some
weary sentry. "There, my boy, sit
down," he would say, without a trace
of condescension.</p>

   <hr class="short" />
<p>
Lord Debenham succeeded because
even in small things he could look
ahead. "Ethelred," he would say
to his batman, "there is to be a field-day
to-morrow, so see that my haversack,
water-bottle and slacks are put
ready for me in the morning."</p>
<p>
"Very good, my lord," the orderly
would answer.</p>

Marmaduke sprang forward. The
Hun's bomb, its pin withdrawn, was
about to explode. Coolly removing his
costly gold-and-diamond tie-pin, he
thrust this substitute into the appointed
place in the terrible sizzling
bomb, and stood back with a little
smile. The next moment his General
stepped towards him and pinned to his
breast the Victoria Cross.</p>

  <hr class="short" />
<p>
Colonel Blood belonged to the old
school&mdash;irascible, even explosive, but
at bottom a heart of gold. Often after
thrashing a subaltern with his cane for
some neglect of duty he would smile
suddenly and invite the offender to dine
with him at the Regimental Mess as if
nothing had happened.</p>

<h3>A NEW DANGER.</h3>
<p>
"I don't know if you realise," said
Ernest, "that since Army signalling
became fashionable a new danger confronts
us."</p>
<p>
"If you mean that an enthusiast
might start semaphoring unexpectedly
in a confined space and get his neighbour
in the eye, I may say that I have
thought of it," I answered. "But it
isn't worth worrying very much about.
He wouldn't do it more than once."</p>
<p>
"It isn't that," said Ernest. "It's
something much more subtle and insidious.
It is the growing tendency
in ordinary conversation to use 'Ack'
for A, 'Beer' for B, 'Emma' for M,
'Esses' for S, 'Toe' for T, etc. When
you told me you were going to see your
Aunt at 3 P.M., for instance, you said
'3 Pip Emma.' And it isn't as if you
were at all good at Semaphore or Morse
either.</p>
<p>
"Imagine," he continued, "the effect
upon a congregation of the announcement
from the pulpit that the Reverend
John Smith, Beer Ack, will preach next
Sunday. Or upon a meeting when told
that Mr. Carrington Ponk, J. Pip, will
now speak. Think of Aunt Jane and
all her Societies," he went on gloomily.
"Imagine her saying that she's going
to an Esses Pip G. meeting to-morrow.
It's a dreadful thought. It will extend
to people's initials, too. The great
T.P. will be Toe Pip <span class="sc">O'Connor</span>. Something
will have to be done about it."</p>
<p>
"There's only one thing to be done,"
I said. "You must get into Parliament
and bring in a Bill about it. All might
yet be well if you were an Emma Pip."</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>
<p>
<i>Wednesday, February 7th.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">His
Majesty</span> opened Parliament to-day for
what we all hope will be the Victory
Session. But it will not be victory
without effort. That was the burden
of nearly all the speeches made to-day,
from the <span class="sc">King's</span> downwards. <span class="sc">His
Majesty</span>, who had left his crown and
robes behind, wore the workmanlike
uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet; and
the Peers had forgone their scarlet and
ermine in favour of khaki and sable.
When Lord <span class="sc">Stanhope</span>, who moved
the Address, ventured, in the course
of an oration otherwise sufficiently
sedate, to remark that "the great crisis
of the War had passed," Lord <span class="sc">Curzon</span>
was swift to rebuke this deviation into
cheerfulness. On the contrary, he declared,
we were now approaching "the
supreme and terrible climax of the
War." He permitted himself, however,
to impart one or two comforting
items of information with regard to the
arming of existing merchant-ships, the
construction of new tonnage and the
development of inventions for the discovery
and deletion of submarines. For
excellent reasons, no doubt, it was all
a little vague, but in one respect his
statement left nothing to be desired in
the way of precision. "The present
Government, in its seven weeks of
office, had taken but two large and one
small hotels," and is, I gather, marvelling
at its own moderation.</p>
<p>
I was a little disappointed with the
speeches of the Mover and Seconder
of the Address in the Commons, for
of recent years there has been a
great improvement in this difficult
branch of oratory. Sir <span class="sc">Hedworth
Meux</span> must, I think, have been
dazzled by the effulgence of his epaulettes,
which were certainly more highly
polished than his periods. When in
mufti he is much briefer and brighter.
As Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span> however found both
speeches "admirable," no more need
be said.</p>
<p>
The <span class="sc">Leader of the Opposition</span>, as
one must for convenience style him&mdash;though
in truth there is no Opposition,
in the strict sense of the word&mdash;just
said what he ought to have said. For
one brief moment he seemed to be
straying on to dangerous ground, when
he put some questions regarding the
scope of the coming Imperial Conference;
but the rest of his speech was
wholly in keeping with the peroration,
in which he pleaded that in the prosecution
of the Nation's aim there should
be "no jarring voices, no party cross-currents,
no personal or sectional distractions."</p>
<p>
Unfortunately there is a section of
the Commons over which he exercises
no control. When Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span>, as
Leader of the House, rose to reply,
the "jarring voices" of Mr. <span class="sc">Snowden</span>
and others of his kidney were heard in
chorus, calling for the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>.
Mr. <span class="sc">Law</span> paid no attention to the
interruption. He cordially thanked
Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span> for his speech, "the best
possible testimony to the unity of this
country," and assured him that the
Imperial Conference would be primarily
concerned with the successful
prosecution of the War. The <span class="sc">German
Emperor</span> had proved himself a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>
Empire-builder, but it was not his
own empire that he was building.</p>
<p>
Later on Mr. <span class="sc">Pringle</span> reverted to
the absence of the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>,
which he, as a person of taste, interpreted
as "studied disrespect of the
House of Commons." In this view
he was supported by Mr. <span class="sc">King</span>. Mr.
<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> must really be careful.</p>
<p>
Strange to say, no public notice was
taken of another distinguished absentee&mdash;the
Member for East Herts. A few
days ago, after a violent collision with
Mr. <span class="sc">Justice Darling</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Pemberton-Billing</span>
announced his intention of
resigning his seat and submitting himself
for re-election. But since then we
have been given to understand that a
vote of confidence proposed by <span class="sc">Pemberton</span>,
seconded by <span class="sc">Billing</span>, and
carried unanimously by the hyphen,
had convinced him that, as in the
leading case of Mr. <span class="sc">Cecil Rhodes</span>,
"resignation can wait."</p>
<p>
<i>Thursday, February 8th.</i>&mdash;When we
read day by day long lists of merchant
vessels sunk by the enemy submarines
two questions occur to most of us.
How does the amount of tonnage lost
compare with the amount of new tonnage
put afloat, and what is the number
of submarines that the Navy has accounted
for in recent months? Mr.
<span class="sc">Flavin</span> put the first question to-day,
but found Sir <span class="sc">Leo Chiozza Money</span>,
who usually exudes statistics at every
pore, singularly reticent on the subject.
All he would say was that a large
programme of new construction was
in hand.</p>
<p>
Private Members blew off a great
volume of steam to-day on the proposal
of the Government to take the
whole time of the House. Scotsmen,
Irishmen and an Englishman or two
joined in the plea that at least they
should be allowed to introduce their
various little Bills, even if they did not
get any further. Perhaps if a Welshman
had joined the band they might
have been listened to. As it was, only
one of them received any comfort. This
was Mr. <span class="sc">Swift MacNeill</span>, who was
informed that the Bill to deprive the
enemy dukes of their British titles, for
which he has been clamouring these
two years, would shortly be introduced.
But for the rest Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> was
not inclined at this crisis in our fate
to encourage the raising of questions,
most of them acutely controversial,
which would distract attention from
the War.</p>
<p>
On an amendment to the Address
Mr. <span class="sc">Leslie Scott</span> took up his brief for
the British farmer, who, deprived of his
skilled men and faced with higher prices
for fertilizers and feeding-stuffs, was expected
to grow more food without having
any certainty that he would be able
to dispose of it at a remunerative price.
Farming is always a bit of a gamble,
but in present conditions it beats the
Stock Exchange hollow. Some of the
proposals which Mr. <span class="sc">Scott</span> outlined to
improve the situation would have been
denounced as revolutionary three years
ago, and were a little too drastic even
now for Mr. <span class="sc">Prothero</span>. Squeezed
between the <span class="sc">War Minister</span> and the
<span class="sc">Food Controller</span>, the <span class="sc">Minister Of
Agriculture</span> rather resembles the
<i>Dormouse</i> in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>; but
he is really quite all right, thank you.
Mr. <span class="sc">George Lambert</span> thinks that the
author of "The Psalms in Human Life"
is too saintly to tackle Lords <span class="sc">Derby</span>
and <span class="sc">Devonport</span>, but, if my memory
serves me, <span class="sc">David</span>&mdash;no allusion to the
<span class="sc">Premier</span>&mdash;had a rather pretty gift of
invective.</p>
<p>
Let no one say that England is not
at last awake. Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Bathurst</span>
to-night made the terrific announcement
that in some parts of the country
Masters of Hounds are&mdash;shooting
foxes.</p>
<p>
"This brings the War home," said
<span class="sc">Ferdinand the Fearful</span> when he
heard the news.</p>

<h3>THE RECENT TRUCE.</h3>
<p>
Students of geography know that
Ballybun is divided from the back
gardens of Kilterash by the pellucid
waters of that noble stream, the Bun,
which hurls itself over a barrier of old
tin-cans in a frantic effort to find the
sea. But they do not know that this
physical division, long ago bridged, is
nothing to the moral and political
division which will keep the two for
ever asunder.</p>
<p>
Several of our younger citizens have
written to me from the trenches to ask
how the War is progressing. I have
usually in reply quoted the remark of
one of their number on leaving
us for the Front after a short
holiday, that he was now looking
forward to a little peace
and rest. I wish here to add
a postscript to this concerning
a recent unexpected truce.</p>
<p>
Political geography is not
written as it should be, so that
there may be people who have
not even heard of the Great
War between Ballybun and
Kilterash. No one knows for
certain when it started, or why.
A local antiquary, after prolonged
study of chronicles, memorials,
rolls and records, to
say nothing of local churchyards,
refers it with some confidence
to the reign of <span class="sc">Henry</span>
II. (<span class="sc">Louis</span> VII. being King of
France, in the pontificate of
<span class="sc">Adrian</span> IV. and so on), and to
the forcible abduction of a pig
(called the White Pearl) by the
then ruling monarch of Kilterash.
The Editor of <i>The Kilterash
Curfew</i>, in one of his
recent "Readings for the Day
of Rest," remarked that Christian
charity compelled him to
hurl this foul aspersion back in the
teeth of this so-called antiquary; the
whole world knew that the pig had
been born in the parish of Kilterash,
but had "strayed" across the Bun,
as things too often had the habit of
straying.</p>
<p>
I am the "so-called antiquary." My
little pamphlet proves in less than
three hundred pages the truth of my
allegation concerning the abduction of
the White Pearl, giving the original
texts on which I rely and the genealogies
of all concerned in a sordid story.</p>
<p>
Since 1157, as far as history records,
we have been afflicted with only two
periods of truce. One was when, on
hearing of the foul wrong done by the
German Brute in Belgium, we united
in enlisting recruits for our local regiment.
This truce was broken by my
worthy friend, the Editor of <i>The Curfew</i>,
who pointed out, more in anger than in
sorrow, that Ballybun had sent six men
fewer than Kilterash. The second
truce&mdash;again broken by the enemy&mdash;concerned
myself. Wishing to add, if
possible, to the evidence from monuments
contained in my pamphlet, I
was copying an inscription I had only
just discovered in the disused churchyard
of Killyburnbrae, when one of
these light Atlantic showers sprang up
and soaked me to the backbone. The
result was influenza and a high temperature,
which rose while I was reading
<i>The Curfew</i> upon my brochure,
"<i>The White Pearl of Ballybun</i>, an Impartial
Examination with the Original
Documents herein set out and now for
the first time deciphered by a Member
of the Society of Antiquarians. Dedicated
to All Lovers of the Truth.
Printed by the Ballybun Binnacle Press."</p>
<p>
<i>The Curfew</i> said of this fair statement
of the evidence (with the original
documents, mind you) that it smacked
of German scholarship and their graveyard
style of doing things. My blood
boiled at this, and to keep me cool my
niece, who lives with me, pulled down
all the blinds, as the sun was strong.</p>
<p>
An old fish-woman passing by saw
this and said, "Well, well, the poor old
fellow's gone at last! A decent man
in his time, with no taste in fish! We
must all come to it."  From her the
news spread forty miles on either side
of her and reached the Editor of <i>The
Curfew</i> in the middle of a philippic.
Next morning I was astounded to read
in his editorial columns: "Our distinguished
neighbour and friend&mdash;if he
will allow us to call him so&mdash;is now no
more; in other words is gone ... as
<span class="sc">Virgil</span> remarks ... famous antiquarian
... scrupulous and methodical,
and, as we remarked in our last
issue, reminiscent of the palmy days of
the best German monumental scholarship
... our slight differences never
affected the esteem in which we held
him as a patriot, citizen, ratepayer and
Man...."</p>
<p>
Now this  was kindly and fair. I
have written to my worthy
friend and have  proposed to
dedicate to him my forthcoming
work (non-partisan) on the
"Slant Observable in Some
Church-Spires, Part I." When
he had to unbury me, war had
to be resumed&mdash;it was his side
that insisted upon it&mdash;but as
far as the two chieftains are
concerned it is a war without
bitterness.   He now introduces
his attacks with "Our honoured
and able antiquarian
friend"; while my answers
breathe such sentiments as
"The genial editor of that
well-conducted organ."</p>

<h3>A FORWARD MINX.</h3>
<p>
The garden wall was high, yet not
so high but that any young lady bent
on attracting the notice of her neighbours
could look over it. Miss Dot
indeed regarded an outside flight of
steps which led to an upper storey as
an appointed amelioration to the hours
which she was expected to spend in
the garden, for it was an easy scramble
from the stairs to the top of the wall,
whence she could survey the world.
To be sure the wall was narrow as
well as high, but a timorous gait shows
off a pretty figure, and slight nervousness
adds a pathetic expression to a
pretty face; to both of which advantages
Dot was not, it is to be believed,
altogether indifferent when khaki coats
dwelt the other side of that wall.</p>
<p>
On this particular day she was trying
to attract notice in so unrestrained a
manner that her mother remarked it
from an upper window. But mothers,
we are told in these latter days, are not
always the wisest guardians of their
"flapper" daughters. This mother had
a decided <i>penchant</i> for a khaki coat herself;
only she demanded braid on the
cuff and a smartly cut collar, and these
she would greet in the street with a
tender act of homage which rarely
failed to win admiring attention. But
for a daughter who would dash down
the road after a Tommy she had contempt
rather than disapproval. So
she watched with interest, but, alas!
with no idea of interference.</p>
<p>
At first there were only "civvies"
about, and though the admiration of any
youthful male was dear to Dot's heart,
and though chaff and blandishments
were not wanting, still the wall <i>was</i> high,
and she lacked the resolve to descend.
But presently two khaki coats appeared
and the matter grew more serious. It
was evident that it was not principle
or modesty that held her back, but just
timidity, for she responded eagerly to
the advances of her admirers, but could
not quite pluck up courage for that long
jump down. Affairs grew shameless,
for the khaki coats fetched a ladder to
assist the elopement; but Dot made it
clear that there were difficulties in that
method of flight, though she wished
there were not. At last she was enticed
to a lower portion of the wall,
and there, half screened by shrubs,
she was lifted off by the shoulders,
deliciously reluctant, and received into
the cordial embrace of an enthusiastic
soldiery.</p>
<p>
And her mother retired to the sofa!</p>
<p>
Shortly afterwards musketry instruction
was proceeding in a public
place; and behind the little group of
learners sat Dot, in the seventh heaven
of joy, drinking it all in with eager
attention. And the instructing officer
did not seem to mind.</p>
<p>
"How sad and mad and bad it was,"
a theme for the moralist, the conscientious
objector, the Army reformer, the
social reformer, the statistician. Yet
perhaps even their solemn faces might
relax to-day at the sight of a long-legged
Airedale puppy marching at the
head of the battalion to which she has
appointed herself mascot.</p>

<p>
<i>Alderman Twentyman .</i>  Mr. <span class="sc">O.B. Clarence</span >.</p>
<p>
<i>Felix Delany . . .</i>         Mr. <span class="sc">Gordon Ash</span >.</p></div>

<p>
This "whimsical comedy," made by
Mr. <span class="sc">Leon M. Lion</span > out of a novel by the
late <span class="sc">Tom Gallon</span >, began in a distinctly
intriguing mood. <i>Felix</i> had an uncle, a
sport, on whom he had once played
a scurvy practical joke. This highly
tolerant victim eventually cut up for a
round million, which he left to nephew
<i>Felix</i> on condition that he should enter
Umberminster as naked as the day he
was born and earn his living therein
for a full calendar month&mdash;a palpable
posthumous hit to the old man. <i>Felix</i>
accordingly, equipped as laid down in
the will, is left by the family solicitor
in a wood, and, after a night and a
day in hiding, appears shivering at the
Mayor's parlour window, abstracts a
rug for temporary relief, and prevails
upon the maid, a romantic little orphan
(who had been reading about river-gods
and mistakes <i>Felix</i> for one), to
borrow a suit of the Mayor's clothes&mdash;into
which he gets in time to interview
that worthy when he returns with his
grim lady. "You'll get a month," says
she with damnable iteration; and the
resourceful <i>Felix</i>, with an eye to the
whimsical will, whimsically suggests
that justice would be better fulfilled by
his putting in the month at the Mayor's
house as odd-job man than by his
being conveyed to the county jail. And
the Mayor whimsically agrees.</p>
<p>
After that, I regret to say, honest
whimsicality took wing, and the show
became merely&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;eupeptic.
And certainly a much more
elaborate meal than my lord <span class="sc">Devonport</span >
allowed me would be required to
induce a mood sufficiently tolerant to
face without impatience the welter
which followed. The three incredible
people&mdash;mercenary virgin, heavy father
and aimless smiling villain&mdash;that walked
straight out of the Elephant and Castle
into the Second Act were not, I suspect,
any elaborate (and quite irrelevant) joke
of the actor-author's at the expense
of the transpontine method, but just
queer puppets brought on to disentangle
the complications, though I confess I
half thought that the villain, Mr. <span class="sc">Lawrence
Leyton</span >, was pulling our legs
with a quite deliberate burlesque. On
the whole I am afraid this play is but
another wreck on that old snag of the
dramatised novel.</p>
<p>
But there were plenty of isolated good
things, such as Mr. <span class="sc">O.B. Clarence's</span >
really excellent Mayor, puzzled, pompous,
eagle-pecked. Miss <span class="sc">Florence
Ivor</span >, the eagle in question, gave a
shrewd and shrewish portrait of a
wife gey ill to live with. Mr. <span class="sc">Reginald
Bach's</span > very entertaining imaginary
portrait of a faithful boy scout was a
stroke of genius, his "call of the wild"
being by far the best whim of the
evening. Miss <span class="sc">Eva Leonard-Boyne</span > as
<i>Ninetta</i>, the orphan, did her little job
tenderly and prettily, but I couldn't
believe in <i>Ninetta</i> in that galley, and I
doubt if she did. Mr. <span class="sc">Gordon Ash</span > was
the debonair hero. I do most solemnly
entreat him to consider the example of
some of the elders in his profession who
have adopted a laugh as their principal
bit of business. It may turn into a
millstone. Was he not laughing the
same laugh on this very stage in a
very different part three days ago? He
was. If he got a month, laugh-barred,
he would profit by the sentence. For
he has jolly good stuff in him.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>
<p>
It may be as well for me to confess at once the humiliating
fact that I am not, and never have been, an Etonian.
If that be a serious disqualification for life in general, how
much more serious must it be for the particular task of
reviewing a book which is of Eton all compact, a book, for
example, like <i>Memories of Eton Sixty Years Ago</i>, by <span  class="sc">A.C.
Ainger</span >, with contributions from <span  class="sc">N.G. Lyttelton</span > and
<span  class="sc">John Murray</span > (<span  class="sc">Murray</span >). For I have never been "up to"
anybody; I have never been present at "absence"; I have
no real understanding of the difference between a "tutor"
and a "dame"; I call a "<i>p&oelig;na</i>" by the plebeian name of
"imposition"; and, until I had read Mr. <span  class="sc">Aingers's</span > book, I
had never heard of the verb "to brosier" or the noun substantive
"bever." Altogether my condition is most deplorable.
Yet there are some alleviations in my lot, and one of
them has been the reading of this delightful book. I found it
most interesting, and can easily imagine how Etonians will
be absorbed in it, for it will revive for them many an old
and joyful memory of the days that are gone. Mr. <span  class="sc">Ainger</span >
discourses, with a <i>mitis sapientia</i> that is very attractive, on
the fashions and manners of the past and the gradual process
of their development into the Eton of the present.
He is proud, as every good Etonian must be, of Eton as it
exists, but now and again he hints that the Eton of an
older time was in some respects a simpler and a better
place. The mood, however, never lasts long, and no one
can quarrel with the way in which it is expressed. General
<span  class="sc">Lyttelton</span >, too, in one of his contributions, relates how
on his return from a long stay in India he visited Eton,
expecting to be modestly welcomed by shy and ingenuous
youths, and how, instead, he was received and patronised
by young but sophisticated men of the world. The
<span  class="sc">General</span >, I gather, was somewhat chilled by his experience.
Altogether this book is emphatically one without which no
Etonian's library can be considered complete.</p>

  <hr />
<p>
Perhaps of all our War correspondents Mr. <span  class="sc">Philip Gibbs</span >
contrives to give in his despatches the liveliest sense of the
movement, the pageantry and the abominable horror of
war. Pageantry there is, for all the evil boredom and
weariness of this pit-and-ditch business, and Mr. <span  class="sc">Gibbs</span >
sees finely and has an honest pen that avoids the easy
<i>cliché</i>. You might truthfully describe his book, <i>The Battles
of the Somme</i> (<span  class="sc">Heinemann</span >), as an epic of the New Armies.
He never seems to lose his wonder at their courage and
their spirit, and always with an undercurrent of sincerely
modest apology for his own presence there with his notebook,
a mere chronicler of others' gallantry. This chronicle
begins at the glorious 1st of July and ends just before
Beaumont-Hamel, which the author miserably missed,
being sent home on sick leave. It is a book that may well
be one of those preserved and read a generation hence by
men who want to know what the great War was really
like. God knows it ought to help them to do something to
prevent another. Yet there is nothing morbid in it. As the
sergeant thigh-deep in a flooded trench said, "You know,
Sir, it doesn't do to take this war seriously." The
armies of a nation that takes its pleasures sadly take
their bitter pains with a grin; and that grin is what has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>
made them such an unexpectedly tough proposition to the
All-Seriousest.</p>

   <hr />
<p>
An old adage warns us never to buy a "pig in a poke."
Equally good advice for the heroines of fiction or drama
would be never under any circumstances to marry a bridegroom
in a mask. In more cases than I can recall, neglect
of this simple precaution has led to a peck of trouble. I
am thinking now of <i>Yvonne</i>, leading lady in <i>The Mark of
Vraye</i> (<span  class="sc">Hutchinson</span >). I admit that poor <i>Yvonne</i> had more
excuse than most. Hers was what you might call a hard
case. On the one hand there was the villain <i>Philippe</i>, a
most naughty man, swearing that she was in his power,
and calling for instant marriage at the hands of <i>Father
Simon</i>, who happened to be present. On the other hand,
the gentleman in the mask revealed a pair of eyes that poor
<i>Yvonne</i> rashly supposed to belong to someone for whom
she had more than a partiality. So when he suggested
that the proposed ceremony should take place during
<i>Philippe's</i> temporary absence
from the stage,
with himself as substitute,
<i>Yvonne</i> (astonished
perhaps at her own luck
so early in the plot)
simply jumped at the
idea. Then, of course,
the deed being done, off
comes the mask, and
behold the triumphant
countenance of her bitterest
foe, <i>Charles de
Montbrison</i>, whom she
herself had disfigured as
the (supposed) murderer
of her brother. Act drop
and ten minutes' interval.
Need I detail for
you the subsequent
course of this marriage
of inconvenience? The
courage and magnanimity
of one side, the
feminine cruelty melting
at last to love, and finally
the inevitable duologue
of reconciliation, through which I can never help hearing
the rustle of opera-cloaks and the distant cab-whistles.
Charming, charming. Mr. <span  class="sc">H.B. Somerville</span > has furnished
a pleasant entertainment, and one that (like all good
readers or spectators) you will enjoy none the less because
of its entire familiarity.</p>

  <hr />
<p>
<i>The Flight of Mariette</i> (<span  class="sc">Chapman and Hall</span >) is a slender
volume, whose simplicity gives it a poignancy both incongruous
and grim. Much of it you might compare to the
diary of a butterfly before and whilst being broken on the
wheel. <i>Mariette</i>, the jolly little maid of Antwerp, was so
tender and harmless a butterfly; and the machine that
broke her life and drove her to the martyrdom of exile was
so huge and cruel a thing. How cruel in its effects it is
well for us just now to be again reminded, lest, in these days
of hurrying horrors, remembrance should be weakened.
To that extent therefore Miss <span  class="sc">Gertrude E.M. Vaughan</span >
has done good service in compiling this human document
of accusation. In a preface Mr. <span  class="sc">John Galsworthy</span >
pleads the cause of our refugee guests, not so much for
charity as for comprehension. Certainly, <i>The Flight of
Mariette</i> will do much to further such understanding. I
think I need only add that half the proceeds of its sale will
go to feed the seven million Belgians still in Belgium (prey
to the twin wolves of Prussia and starvation) for you to
see that three shillings and sixpence could hardly be better
used than in the purchase of a copy.</p>

  <hr />
<p>
I was beginning to wonder whether Mr. <span  class="sc">Eden Phillpotts</span >
was suffering from writer's cramp, so much longer than
usual does it seem since I heard from him. Now, however,
my anxiety is relieved by <i>My Devon Year</i> (<span  class="sc">Scott</span >), a
delightful book which could have come from no other pen
than his. It is a marvel how many fragrant things he
still finds to say, and with what inexhaustible freshness,
about his beloved county. I hesitate to give these sketches
an indiscriminate recommendation, because to those who
walk through the country with closed eyes they will have
little or no meaning; but if you are in love with beauty
and can appreciate its translation into exquisite language
you will draw from them a real and lasting joy. Let me
confess now that I once
asked Mr. <span  class="sc">Phillpotts</span > to
give Devonshire a rest,
and that I accept <i>My
Devon Year</i> as a convincing
proof that this
request was ill-considered.</p>

  <hr />
<p>
I wish Mr. <span  class="sc">Douglas
Sladen</span > would not throw
so many bouquets at his
characters. <i>Roger Wynyard</i>,
the hero of <i>Grace
Lorraine</i> (<span  class="sc">Hutchinson</span >),
was really just a very
ordinary youth, but when
I discovered that he was
"the fine flower of our
Public-School system,"
"as chivalrous as a
Bayard," and so forth,
I began&mdash;unfairly, perhaps,
but quite irresistibly&mdash;to
entertain a
considerable prejudice
against him. Let me
hasten, however, to add that Mr. <span  class="sc">Sladen</span > has packed his
novel with the kind of incident which appeals to the
popular mind, though his conclusion may cause a shock to
those who think that our divorce-laws are in need of
reform. In the matter of style Mr. <span  class="sc">Sladen</span > is content
with something short of perfection. "It was easier for her
to forgive a man, with his happy-go-lucky nature, for
getting into trouble, than to forgive his getting out again
by not being sufficiently careful not to add to the other
person's misfortune." For myself, I do not find it so easy
to forgive these happy-go-lucky methods in a writer who
ought to know better by now.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
